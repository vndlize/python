Convolutional Layer
> designed to automatically learn features about the input data
> consists of kernels ( learnable filters ) along w input data . the kernels slide over data and extract local patterns and features
> here , the edges , features , textures are detected
> after convolution , activation function is applied (example : ReLU)

> why is it used ???
    > Feature Detection
    > Spatial Hierarchies
    > Weight Sharing
    > Efficient Computation 

> when is it used ???
    > Used for image classification 
    > Face recognition , object detection 
    > Video analysis
    > NLP

> Formula 
    > Output Size (Height or Width) = [(Input Size + 2 * Padding - Filter Size) / Stride] + 1
        where input size -> height / width of feature map
        padding -> number of rows / columns of zeroes before applying convolution
        filter size -> size of convolutional filter
        stride -> step size at which filter moves across feature map
