Loss Function 
quantifies the dissimilarity between the predicted output (the model's output) and the actual target values (ground truth) for a given input

    > Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Loss
    > Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
    > Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
    > Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
    > Hinge Loss
